Free IM is a research project focused on instant messengers and online chats, which have existed for 30 years. Multiple protocols and service providers exist with thousands of official and non-official clients.  
This research focuses on usability and efficiency. Find the issues and the possible solutions it has.
   

This research is about four issues, and I believe they are not unique to me. 

  1. Some communication apps demand excessive permissions on the phone. If you remove the permission, the app won't work.
  1. Some apps cannot be tricked with mocked GPS locations.
  1. Most apps consume 200-1000 megabytes of memory. It's okay if you use only one or two apps, but having 10 apps can be problematic. In my case: I have to use multiple communication software such as Discord, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Slack, Telegram, Microsoft Teams, Zulip, Viber, Whatsapp, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Tox, and Matrix. I have no idea how others manage this, but for me, it's quite challenging. I need to find a solution to that. 
  1. Some apps do not care about your privacy like TikTok. That is a big problem too.

I'm not sure if I have any chance of finishing this. At the moment, my hobby projects have 4000+ issues. I am hoping to find some help here, as I have already started taking some basic steps.
